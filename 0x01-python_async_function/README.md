# Python - Async

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Requirements

### General

- **Editors**: You are allowed to use vi, vim, or emacs for coding.
- **Python Version**: All code will be interpreted/compiled using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- **File Endings**: Ensure that all your files end with a newline character.
- **Shebang Line**: The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **README.md**: A mandatory README.md file must be present at the root of your project folder.
- **Code Style**: Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- **Executable Files**: All your Python files must be executable.
- **File Length**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- **Documentation**: 
  - All your modules should have documentation. You can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
  - All your classes should have documentation. You can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.
  - All your functions, both inside and outside a class, should have documentation. You can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.

### Collaborators

- ANAS HOUMAID

### Documentation Guidelines

- A documentation is not just a single word; it should be a complete sentence that explains the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of your documentation will be verified.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you improve your Python programming skills with a focus on Understanding Synchronous vs. Asynchronous 

### Basics of Asynchronous Programming in Python

Python provides support for asynchronous programming using the asyncio library.
